## extensions for olive
A key part of this packages design philosophy is extensibility. New functionality for `Olive` is loaded by adding new methods to specific functions using a symbolic type parameter.
This allows us to create our own project types that behave in customizable ways, our own cells, our own file-reading and saving systems, and the ability to completely replace the `Olive` UI... And by no means is that comprehensive. There are a plethora of different extension types available in `Olive`:
## file cells

## session cells

## directories

## projects

## environments
