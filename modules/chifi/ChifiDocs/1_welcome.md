welcome to chifi docs! The **new** *interactive* `chifi` documentation website. This is a centralized source for accessing information on all **6** `chifi` ecosystems. 
#### links

## overview
`chifi` itself is an ecosystem, consisting of **chifi websites** (`CC BY 4.0`/`MIT-0`), **chifi servers** (`MIT-0`), 
and **random, out-of-ecosystem** packages (`MIT-0`). 
- `chifi-tag`
We are currently targeting the creation of **6** powerful ecosystems for Julia. Each ecosystem includes a base package and several extensions to further radicalize the capabilities of that base package. Of these ecosystems, three have launched and have packages available for use right now. These three are
- `parametric-tag`
- `toolips-tag`
- `gattino-tag`

## info
`chifi` is a *loosely organized* group of collaborators building new and exciting software ecosystems for the `julia` programming language and `GNU-Linux`-based operating systems. This is *not* an **enterprise**, " business", or *venture* but a connecting web between independent developers with similar goals. Everything that we make is for the *people of earth* to enjoy and holds an open license.

## licensing
- All `chifi` software is distributed with the `MIT-0` *ultra-permissive* software license. You are free to do *whatever you want* with `chifi` software, for example you could copy `Toolips` and distribute or modify it without [attribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribution_(marketing)) or **any other requirements**.
- `chifi` *content* is published under the `Creative-Commons BY 4.0` (*creative commons with attribution*) license. For `chifi` images, documents, and web-pages, we require [attribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribution_(marketing)), but you are free to use them however you want so long as that attribution is provided. Note the distinction between *webpage* and *software* here -- you are not allowed to deploy `ChifiDocs` by itself, but you could use `ChifiDocs` or `Documator` to create **your own** website and freely distribute this. By using `chifi` documentations and websites, you agree to the `EULA` (*End User License Agreement*).
