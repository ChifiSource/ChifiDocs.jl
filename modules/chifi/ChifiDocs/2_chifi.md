`chifi` is a *loosely organized* group of collaborators building new and exciting software ecosystems for the `julia` programming language and `GNU-Linux`-based operating systems. Everything that we make is for the *people of earth* to enjoy and holds an open license. Becoming a collaborator is as simple as forking a project, making a contribution, and then creating a pull-request; anyone can contribute to `chifi` software on [Github](https://github.com/ChifiSource) and anyone may freely join this organization. These contributions can come in a variety of forms, including reporting your own issues or simply updating a `README` for the rest of the community to use. Thank you for considering a contribution, and thank you for visiting our documentation website to begin with.
### contributing guidelines
A big motivation for `chifi` is to get *everyone* more involved in programming and the programming community. As a result, we try to be incredibly leniant in our pull-request approval. *Eventually*, we hope to foster a real community around our websites and offer a number of free and open-source services. While we are not too strict regarding what maintainers choose to merge, *most* repositories will likely require the following to merge:
- A pull-request should be made to `Unstable`, rather than `main`.

For issues, we will respond to any issue within the week, but *it will make it easier* to solve your issue if you are able to start that issue with the following:
- When opening an issue, open a specific issue -- for multiple issues, open multiple issues.
- We would prefer if you copy and pasted a stacktrace or gave us some kind of information about your error.
- Operating system info and Julia version.

Again, thank you for contributing to `chifi` and all apologies if these guidelines are a bit hard to work out. Above all, communication is key and discretion will be used in every case.
