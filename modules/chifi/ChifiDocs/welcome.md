```
welcome to chifi docs! The **new** `chifi` *interactive* documentation website. This is a centralized source for accessing information on all **6** `chifi` ecosystems, including `parametric`, `toolips`, `gattino`, `olive`, `algebra frames`, and `tumble`.
### navigation
There are four main portions to this website: 
- The main menu,
- the left menu, 
- the tab bar,
- and the content window.

Navigating documentation begins in the main menu, where we select ecosystem and then 
subsequent `Module` for which we wish to retrieve documentation. After selecting a `Module`, 
the left menu and the content window will populate with that `Module`'s documentation.
### tabs
Tabs are opened by clicking arrows around `ChifiDocs`. There are arrows inside of pop-up doc-strings, the left menu, 
and occassionally inside of built-in links. Tabs may also be closed by clicking on the moon button inside of them.
### interacting with documentation
Documentation on this website yields itself in a few different ways. Firstly, there are the standard markdown explanations -- such as this document -- which give the most in-depth and easy-to-follow overview. There is also a *reference* for each `Module`, which contains all of the doc-strings for a given module. Any name from a given module will appear as a blue, clickable element. For example, `start_from_project`. When these elements are clicked, this will yield a small pop-up with more information on the documentation. There are also different types of code blocks, all with their own interactive features. 
```julia
# click the `copy` button above to copy this code.
function example(x::Any)
    
end
```
Check out this `sample` for more information on doc-strings.
