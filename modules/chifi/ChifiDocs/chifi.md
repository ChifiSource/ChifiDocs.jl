## info
`chifi` is a *loosely organized* group of collaborators building new and exciting software ecosystems for the `julia` programming language and `GNU-Linux`-based operating systems. This is *not* an **enterprise**, " business", or *venture* but a connecting web between independent developers with similar goals. Everything that we make is for the *people of earth* to enjoy and holds an open license.

## contributing
The central premise of `chifi` as collaboration, and as such our intention is to be more leniant than most developers when allowing outside contributors to get involved.
