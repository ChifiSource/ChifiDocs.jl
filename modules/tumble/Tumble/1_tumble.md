## tumble
The `Tumble` ecosystem is currently only a plan, a plan to revise old `Lathe` code into a more usable formfactor built for modern Julia with an emphasis on algebraic transformations brought about by `AlgebraFrames`, as well as package agnosticity for data-management dependencies using base-binded generators and "getters" like `eachcol`.
