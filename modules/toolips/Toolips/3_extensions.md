## multiroute
`Connections` are one of the many ways that `Toolips` may be extended. Routes are dispatched to a Connection, which represents a certain type of Connection. We are able to dispatch routes with connections to write multiple routes for different set types of incoming connections. For instance, `Toolips` includes the `MobileConnection` extension. Here is an example of a website which serves mobile clients with one function and desktop clients with another:

```docstrings
MobileConnection
AbstractConnection
```
