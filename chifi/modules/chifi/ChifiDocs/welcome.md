###### chifi docs
welcome to chifi docs! The **new** `chifi` *interactive* documentation website. 
## using chifi docs

### tabs
Tabs are opened by clicking arrows around `ChifiDocs`.
### interacting with documentation
Documentation on this website yields itself in a few different ways. Firstly, there are the standard markdown explanations -- such as this document -- which give the most in-depth and easy-to-follow overview. There is also a *reference* for each `Module`, which contains all of the doc-strings for a given module.
```julia
# click the `copy` button above to copy
function example(x::Any)
    
end
```
